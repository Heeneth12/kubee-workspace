# Reports API: Frontend Guide (Angular)

The five core reports from the MVP: day sales, payment modes, item-wise sales, GST summary (for the CA)
and cancellations/refunds. All read-only.

- Backend: Kubee POS (`pos`), default port **8086**
- Base path: **`/api/v1/reports`**
- Headers, response envelope, errors and conventions: same as the catalog, see [`catalog-api.md`](catalog-api.md) section 1.

## 1. Basics

Every report takes the same period:

| Param | Format | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `from` | `yyyy-MM-dd`, inclusive | today (India) |
| `to` | `yyyy-MM-dd`, inclusive | today |

- `GET /api/v1/reports/sales-summary` with no params = today's day-end summary.
- At most **366 days** (a full financial year fits). `from` after `to`, or a longer range → `422`.
- Days run midnight to midnight, shop time.

**Which events count, and when.** Each figure is counted on the day it happened:

| Figure | Counted from | Dated by |
|---|---|---|
| Sales, item-wise | orders that are `COMPLETED` (fully paid) | completion time |
| Collected / refunded, payment modes | successful payments and refunds | payment time |
| GST | bills with status `ISSUED` (cancelled bills excluded) | bill date |
| Cancellations | cancelled orders / bills, refunds | cancel / refund time |

So an order paid today but completed yesterday shows in yesterday's sales and today's collections. Open and
held orders are never sales.

## 2. Endpoints and models

### 2.1 Day sales: `GET /reports/sales-summary?from&to`

```ts
export interface SalesSummaryReport {
  from: string; to: string;
  completedOrders: number;
  grossSales: number;        // before discounts
  discountAmount: number;
  taxableAmount: number;
  taxAmount: number;
  roundOffAmount: number;
  netSales: number;          // what customers were charged (sum of grand totals)
  averageOrderValue: number;
  collected: number;         // payments received in the period
  refunded: number;          // refunds given in the period
  netCollected: number;      // collected − refunded = money that should be in the drawer/bank
  cancelledOrders: number;
  billsIssued: number;       // bills dated in the period (incl. ones cancelled later)
  billsCancelled: number;    // bills cancelled in the period
  days: { date: string; orders: number; netSales: number; taxAmount: number; averageOrderValue: number }[];
}
```

`days` has one row per day that had sales, for a daily chart on longer ranges.

### 2.2 Payment modes: `GET /reports/payment-modes?from&to`

```ts
export interface PaymentModeRow {
  method: 'CASH' | 'UPI' | 'CARD' | 'WALLET' | 'BANK_TRANSFER' | 'OTHER' | null;  // null on the total row
  paymentCount: number; paymentAmount: number;
  refundCount: number; refundAmount: number;
  netAmount: number;
}
export interface PaymentModeReport { from: string; to: string; methods: PaymentModeRow[]; total: PaymentModeRow; }
```

`methods` is sorted by amount. The CASH `netAmount` is what the cash drawer should hold from sales.

### 2.3 Item-wise sales: `GET /reports/items?from&to&categoryUuid&sort`

- `sort`: `AMOUNT` (default, best sellers by value) or `QUANTITY`
- `categoryUuid`: only items currently in that category (sub-category uuid for e.g. "Hot Drinks")

```ts
export interface ItemSalesRow {
  itemUuid: string | null; itemName: string;
  variantUuid: string | null; variantName: string | null;   // one row per item + variant
  categoryName: string | null;
  unitOfMeasure: string;
  quantity: number;
  orderCount: number;        // orders it appeared in
  grossAmount: number; discountAmount: number; taxableAmount: number; taxAmount: number;
  netAmount: number;         // after discounts, incl. GST
  shareOfSales: number;      // % of totalNetAmount
}
export interface ItemSalesReport { from: string; to: string; totalNetAmount: number; items: ItemSalesRow[]; }
```

`totalNetAmount` excludes the order round-off, so it can differ from `netSales` by a few rupees. Refunds are
recorded per payment, not per item, so they aren't taken off here.

### 2.4 GST summary: `GET /reports/gst?from&to`

Laid out like GSTR-1, for the shop's CA. Built from **issued** bills only.

```ts
export interface GstReport {
  from: string; to: string;
  totals: {
    invoiceCount: number; taxableAmount: number;
    cgst: number; sgst: number; igst: number; cess: number; totalTax: number;
    roundOff: number; invoiceValue: number;          // invoice value = bill totals incl. round-off
  };
  byRate: { rate: number; taxableAmount: number; cgst: number; sgst: number; igst: number; cess: number;
            totalTax: number; invoiceValue: number }[];          // invoiceValue here excludes round-off
  b2bInvoices: { billNumber: string; billDate: string; customerGstin: string; customerName: string | null;
                 placeOfSupply: string; taxableAmount: number; cgst: number; sgst: number; igst: number;
                 cess: number; invoiceValue: number }[];         // one row per B2B invoice
  b2c: { placeOfSupply: string | null; rate: number; taxableAmount: number;
         cgst: number; sgst: number; igst: number; cess: number }[];   // unregistered buyers, by state + rate
  hsn: { hsnSacCode: string | null; unitOfMeasure: string; rate: number; quantity: number; taxableAmount: number;
         cgst: number; sgst: number; igst: number; cess: number; totalValue: number }[];
  ordersWithoutBill: number;   // completed orders in the period with no issued bill: their tax is NOT in here
  cancelledBills: number;      // bills dated in the period that were cancelled (excluded above)
}
```

- `byRate`, `hsn` and `b2bInvoices` + `b2c` each add up to the `totals`.
- **Show a warning when `ordersWithoutBill > 0`**: GST was charged on those orders but no invoice was issued.
- `hsn` rows with `hsnSacCode: null` are items with no HSN code in the catalog. The CA will need one.

### 2.5 Cancellations & refunds: `GET /reports/cancellations?from&to`

```ts
export interface CancellationReport {
  from: string; to: string;
  cancelledOrderCount: number; cancelledOrderValue: number;
  cancelledBillCount: number; cancelledBillValue: number;
  refundCount: number; refundAmount: number;
  cancelledOrders: { orderUuid: string; orderNumber: string; createdAt: string; cancelledAt: string;
                     cancelledBy: string | null; reason: string; lineCount: number; orderValue: number }[];
  cancelledBills: { billUuid: string; billNumber: string; orderNumber: string; billDate: string;
                    cancelledAt: string; cancelledBy: string | null; reason: string; billValue: number }[];
  refunds: { paymentUuid: string; orderUuid: string; orderNumber: string; method: string; amount: number;
             reason: string | null; refundedAt: string; refundedBy: string | null }[];
}
```

Newest first. `cancelledBy` / `refundedBy` are user uuids. Show them against the shop's staff list
to see who is cancelling a lot.

## 3. Errors

| `422` | `'from' must be on or before 'to'` |
| `422` | `A report can cover at most 366 days` |
| `400` | `Malformed request: Method parameter 'from' …` (bad date) / `'sort' …` (not `AMOUNT`/`QUANTITY`) |
